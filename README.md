# ViewOnlyPDF  

### **Disclaimer**  
This script is intended for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and ensure compliance with copyright laws and terms of service.

---

## **Overview**  
The **ViewOnlyPDF** script allows users to download view-only Google Drive PDFs that cannot be directly downloaded. By capturing high-quality screenshots of each page, it combines them into a single PDF file for offline use.

---

## **How It Works**  
1. The script scans all pages of the PDF visible in the browser.  
2. It takes high-resolution screenshots of the pages.  
3. Each page's dimensions are analyzed to maintain the original aspect ratio.  
4. Screenshots are joined sequentially to generate a new PDF file.  

---

## **Features**  
- High-quality PDF generation.  
- Automated handling of page orientations (portrait/landscape).  
- Easy-to-use and lightweight.  

---

## **Steps to Use**  
1. **Open the PDF in Google Drive**  
   - Navigate to the view-only PDF you wish to download.  

2. **Scroll Through the Entire PDF**  
   - Ensure all pages are fully loaded by scrolling to the end of the document.  

3. **Open the Browser Console**  
   - Press `F12` or right-click and select **Inspect**.  
   - Go to the **Console** tab.  

4. **Enable Pasting in the Console**  
   - If pasting is not allowed, type `allow pasting` in the console.  

5. **Paste the Script**  
   - Copy the script from this repository and paste it into the console.  

6. **Generate and Download the PDF**  
   - The script will process the images and download the PDF automatically.  
   - Wait for the download to complete.  

---

## **Prerequisites**  
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).  
- Internet access to load the Google Drive PDF.  

---

## **Important Notes**  
- **Ethical Use:** Ensure that you have the right to download and use the PDF before running this script. Unauthorized use may violate intellectual property rights.  
- **Performance:** Processing large documents with many pages may take time.  
- **Compatibility:** The script works for most view-only PDFs hosted on Google Drive but may not support other platforms.
